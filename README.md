# Net7-Internship
Degree internship project. 
The work consisted in devising and implement an effective heuristic capable of recognizing duplicates of scientific publications by having only the metadata relating to the documents available. The work has consisted in a first phase of research and study of the problem, extensively treated in the literature, followed from an analysis of the available data. Having finally devised a reasonable heuristic, we have passed a first test to empirically validate the effectiveness of the approach chosen for the recognition of duplicates (on a dataset of 240 documents, created specifically for measurements) and a subsequent code robustness test on a dataset of over 150,000 documents.
